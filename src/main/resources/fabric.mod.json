	"description": "This mod makes certain blocks overtake others slowly over time.  The blocks that spread are those in #blockspreading:spreads, and the blocks that can be overtaken are in #blockspreading:substrates.  By default the only block that spreads is netherrack, and it can spread into ordinary overworld stones.",
